            Why invest? Because it's a great way to make passive income meaning that it is income that requires little effort to maintain. 
            Investing, in other words, can help you advance in life. It may play a significant role in assisting you to increase your value 
            over time and secure the kind of future you want for your family and yourself. You might be able to make money while you sleep thanks to it. 
            Determining how everything functions will therefore be worthwhile, without a doubt. In contrast, it's a lot when you're new. There are several options, 
            numerous unfamiliar terminology and ideas, and numerous pieces of challenging, even contradictory advice to sort through. In addition, it might be 
            stressful because it involves risking your money. So, I'd like to share some tips for investing that I hope you can gain some value from.

                The biggest misconception about investing is that it’s reserved for the rich. That might’ve been true in the past. But that barrier 
                to entry is gone today, knocked down by companies and services that have made it their mission to make investment options available 
                for everyone, including beginners and those who have just small am ounts of money to put to work. Acorns is a tool that will help you 
                make the most of your spare change by allowing you to invest slowly over time. Click <a href="https://www.acorns.com/" style="color:navy"> here</a> to learn more.

                2.  Be Aware of High-Risk Investments 
            </li>
            <img src="./Images/cryptoImage.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                All investments contain a certain amount of risk, but certain investments are riskier than others. Alternative investment products and 
                methods that fall outside of the mainstream investing categories are considered high-risk investments. Some high-risk investments could 
                be promoted as having the potential to yield larger profits. But keep in mind that investment returns are never assured and are determined 
                by variables outside of the control of an organization or an individual. Some of the most popular high-risk investments include penny stocks, 
                cryptocurrency and NFTs, as well as forex trading.

                Diversifying your assets is one method for achieving risk-reward balance in your investing portfolio. Although there are many 
                alternative ways to combine assets under this strategy, the fundamental concept is to distribute your portfolio across many asset classes. 
                Diversification can potentially reduce the quantity and intensity of uncomfortable volatility by minimizing uncertainty and risk in your portfolio.
                For example, instead of just purchasing shares from companies in the tech industry, try investing in energy, healthcare, etc. Diversifying is not only for 
                the stock market. If you are heavily invested in the stock market, look at the housing market and precious metals as other viable options.

                Take Advantage of Employer Matching
            </li>
            <img src="./Images/retirement-plan-financial-investment-application-form-concept.jpg" alt="">
            <p>When an employer matches your contributions, they fund your 401(k) account in addition to what you put in. Employers may decide 
                to match a portion of an employee's contribution, up to a specific threshold, as one way to calculate matching contributions. 
                Most mid- to large-sized businesses provide some sort of retirement benefit. It's like leaving free money on the table if you don't 
                take advantage of an employer match.
